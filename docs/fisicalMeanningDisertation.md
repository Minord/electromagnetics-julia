# What is that i am looking for

All the propourse of making studies on 
electromagnetisim is develop a technology
for metall possesing firt abaout extractive
prosses and aditive prosses the first one
can be thinking as a way of making cut
thoug materials in our case the focus is
on metallic materials. The the cases of it
is develop a effiecient and flexible mode
of making this cutting with a basic obserbation
off all posible methods for cutting metals
all of them deals with the heat of the applied zone
grinding, plasma, hot gas and laser.

All of those methods works with the principle of
fasting applied heat on disvantages of this methods
over mechanical machinning are the waste of the heat
applied specifically with hot gas and plasma.
The blow up the melted resiudes of the prosse.

One can tell that the most controllable way of making 
working this principle is with ligth and metal
vaporization. Then push it with a lot of vapotization
of metals. 

On that case what we should make is basically is 
know that the mechanisim that heat electrons in the
case of laser is the mechamisim is the movement of
electron moving by ligth that by the resistance of 
material it affect the lattice movement that at the
finnal level is the heat of the metallic lattice of metal
making it sublime and delete. the material.

The plasma version of it is by creating hot gas that tranfers
it energy to the metal lattice by the waves of ligth move the
free electrons on the material that eventually translate to 
the metal lattice. That is how that things work. rigth

## The way of working of torch cutting
In the case of torch way we have is a chemical 
reaction between and flamable gas and oxigen
the with that reaction is creating an hot
air jet that when is contact of metal tranlate
the heat and with the drag of the jet it
blows the drops of melted metal.

## The way of working of plasma cutting
The way that the plasma methods is verry similar
the only difference is the mechanisim for creating 
the heat the electric resistance on an electrical breakdown
that create that way of working.

## The way tha laser cutting 
The laser cutting is best because the heat dont loose on
the air or difusse on the sorrounded atmofered 
that make that the efficient of lasser is good. But
has creating that beam of ligth is more sofisticated
it requiered expensive equiepment. But laser cutting
is the suppirior method offcurse.

## The way the electro discharge machining work
This methos that have an electrode near the machinned surface
and generate an electric discharge on the piece that blows
some metallic surface and the thermal expansion of the metal on the case
of this methos blows up the melted metal on that sense


## Polar Laser Beam cutting
Then the most feasible method of making this thing working
is with making a curring with the same principle of laser
cutting but tryings different configurations that are optimized
for cutting methos i wondering is a poralize beam of ligth
is most effient heating a metal part that the last part
that that is the most feasible way of finding the rigth method
what configuration of electromagnetic treatment heat most effient
fast and smal part of a metal that is a very great question
and ofcurse the most important thing is how fast it is and how
afficient it is in terms of energy usage. Then making it


## That is one concrete question

Then i think that a correct question may be what 
is the electromagenetic force that can heat more a piece of 
bulk iron. That is a good question what is the most efficient way
of  doing and archive that.

## Metal Properties Structure and Elements

In the case of metals seams that the problem is aboiv
the reemision of ligth and make that the material absorbs 
all of it this is a question is how make and efficient
pell of of the metal surface. Because the is the only 
were we can act on by the nature of metal the one of
the most common things is thinking if we have and current
in a bulk of metal how maky power we need for heat up the
material to 4000 Kelvins that is the adecuate temperature
of the materias as is very hard to see metal at microscopic
level then all that we can do is create a mental model
of it in our minds. But what are the good models that can
help to do one of the most closed and acurrate description
of the phenomena that i an looking is solid state phisics.
I will take a look on that for see if i can get some
inspiration abaut what we can know or not 
* Into more sesitive is the beam most heat can be generated.

## The Interface Atmosphere Discharge Breack Down

Mabe is a good idea take advantage of the charge iside
a conductor is 0 take advantege of creating voltaje near the conductor
the electric arc will pass in the atmosphere that is actually a great idea
for generate plasma and heat in a very precice way
