In this case what we have is some calsses


#This that are relly well in my program

Firts one of the things that i think that are really good
is the exposure of the method of the class subdivide i think
that in this file the text is quite messy but how you may think
what this has is 

#Is okey to create varius arguments model for a same function
#It has performace effectes

Well sintactically i think that is okey the way on what we use the
functions of the elements

method(vec)
method(v1)
method(v1, v2)
method(v1, v2, v3)

and this are the methods that are exposes on public APIs
and this thinks works rellativily fine in this
case i think that is an acceptable method but maybe best
making only one of it.

The name what we give to the code is really bad
i thinks that really dont discribe correctly the name of 
the variables that we are using i think that 
the subdivide methos is an ok name in this case.

Here a a lot of way for optimization on this structures.
and can be statically vectors but i think that is best if 
we only keep like it for now

Okey the we will only conpromize the public method of the part.

But i think i dont understand really well it case of use
and  we can make it base on the use of matrix vectorizatio
in the case of use of this notation is realli bad

method.(args...) is really confusing for other the avoid the
use of it.

This code acctually has a lot of similars result to an
request can help predifine the values and dont calculate it 
in other sense maybe a system of cache of statically
defined casses. And this code can be created in other ways
but this code works fine if it is requiere tho make best
on this code we should make it a change for now it will keep like it

#The testing of this classes

In a lot of ways we the testing site of this classes has ben
conplicated for the type of output that this things give us
but it help a lot on it and maybe is this more interesting discussion
that the last
